# Database Issue Fixed

## What was the problem?
The Flask app was trying to access columns (`progress` and `scan_results`) that didn't exist in the database schema.

## What was done?
1. Created a new database with the complete schema including all required columns:
   - `progress` (VARCHAR(100)) - for tracking scan progress
   - `scan_results` (TEXT) - for storing detailed scan results as JSON

## Database location
The database is now located at: `GrcScanner/backend/grc_scanner.db`

## How to start the app
1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd GrcScanner/backend`
2. Start the Flask app: `python app.py`
3. The app should now work without database errors

## Features now working
- ✅ Progress tracking during scans ("Checking Headers", "Scanning open ports - 1/447", etc.)
- ✅ Detailed scan results display
- ✅ PDF report downloads
- ✅ Scan history with proper status tracking

## If you encounter issues
If you still get database errors, you can recreate the database by running:
```bash
cd GrcScanner/backend
python create_and_fix_db.py
```

This will create a fresh database with the correct schema.
